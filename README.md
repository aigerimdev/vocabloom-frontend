## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, Axios, Dictionary API
- **Fronted Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library

## How It Works
- The React frontend talks to a Django REST API.
- Authentication uses **access** and **refresh** tokens for secure login and session renewal.
- After signing in, users can:
  - **Search** words (phonetics, meanings, definitions, examples, audio).
  - **Save** words to *My Word List* with or without a tag.
  - **Add/Edit Personal Notes** on any saved word.
  - **Generate Example Sentences** with Gemini AI (choose difficulty and context).
  - **Listen to Audio** for words and examples via Amazon Polly (natural TTS).
  - **Add Personal Words** ‚Äî create your own entries (word, phonetics, meanings, examples, optional tag) using **PersonalWordForm**. These behave like saved words: you can tag them, add notes, generate/listen to examples, and delete them if needed.
- Destructive actions (e.g., deleting a word or tag) use a confirmation modal, and any errors are shown inline with an error banner.
- Destructive actions (e.g., deleting a word or tag) require confirmation, and any errors are shown inline.
