# Vocabloom (Frontend)

Mobile-first vocabulary learning app. Search words, save them, tag by topic, and add personal notes. All main pages are protectedâ€”users must sign up and log in.

## Goal
Vocabloom is designed for **English learners**, especially those studying English as a second language (ESL).  
It helps users build and organize their vocabulary by:
- **Search powered by an open dictionary API** â€” when a user types a word, the app retrieves **phonetics**, **audio**, **part of speech**, **meanings**, **definitions**, and **examples**.
- Saving and tagging words for easy review
- Adding personal notes
- Accessing their word collection anytime on mobile, tablet, or desktop
